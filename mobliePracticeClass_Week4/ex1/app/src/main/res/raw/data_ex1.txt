Yesterday I saw a film titled Macbeth. Its story elements are interesting. The film’s hero, Macbeth, assassinates Duncan and ascends to the throne of Scotland. But he is dissatisfied. He finds himself in a dangerous situation. He executes those he suspects of plotting against him. Eventually, some of the lords revolted and dethroned him and killed him. The message it conveys is that excessive ambition destroys a man. The actor and actress who played Macbeth and Lady Macbeth had exceptional performances, which significantly increased the film’s impact.
